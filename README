Pyensembl README
===========

Introduction
------------

Pyensembl is a Google Summer of Code project used to prototype an Ensembl API us
ing standard Pygr - a Python Graph Database Framework components.  The functiona
lity of this API focuses on data retrieval from the core Ensembl database system
.

Latest Release
--------------

http://code.google.com/p/pygr
 
Documentation
-------------

pyensembl-0.1.0/doc/Tutorial.pdf is a good place to start. 


Core Prerequisites
-----------------

1) Python >= 2.5

2) Pygr >= 0.7.1
	
Supported Platforms
-------------------

In theory, pyensembl should work on any platform that adequately supports python and Pygr.

Here are the OS's we've successfully tested on:

o Linux 2.6.x
o OS X 

Installation
------------

Installing pyensembl is quite simple. 

1) tar -xzvf pyensembl-0.1.0.tar.gz 
2) cd pyensembl-0.1.0
3) python setup.py install 

The setup script
will install pyensembl into python's respective site-packages directory. 
If you don't want to install pyensembl into your system-wide site-packages,
replace the "python setup.py install" command with
"python setup.py build".  This will build pyensembl but not install it
in site-packages.

Using Pyensembl
----------
Pyensembl contains several modules imported as follows:
from ensembl import adaptor # IMPORT ADAPTOR MODULE

If you did not install pyensembl in your system-wide site-packages, you 
must set your PYTHONPATH to the location of your pyensembl build.

Pyensembl has a myriad of applications, however, providing a comprehensive 
description of its utility is out of the scope of this document (see
Documentation). 

If you wish to test your install using the provided test scripts, 
follow these steps:

1) cd pyensembl/tests/ 
2) python testadaptor.py
3) python testdatamodel.py

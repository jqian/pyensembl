Running Tests:
First, you must have nose installed. To get nose, see
http://www.somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/

Then simply go to the pygr/tests directory and run the tests:

cd pygr/tests
python protest.py

Note: depending on what modules you have installed, and what data 
resources you have available locally, some tests may be skipped; 
it will indicate which tests were skipped.

You can also run individual test files by name:
python protest.py pygrdata_test.py

To run ALL tests, including very time-consuming and resource-intensive 
NLMSA build tests, tell it to run our ``megatests'':
python protest.py *_megatest.py

NOTE: what is protest.py?
For testing pygr.Data, it is helpful to use a testing framework that 
enables each test to run in a separate process. Since nose does not allow 
this, we use a small script compatible with nose, that runs the each 
test in a separate process (i.e. separate Python interpreter session).

For more details, see the Pygr Testing Documentation.

PEP 8 -- line lengths
         testutil.TempDir( 'blast-test' ) <-- spacing inside parens?

imports within functions (blast_test)

==================

can all tests be combined into a single test suite?
  maybe you don't want this so that tests can be skipped or whatever
  what's the return code if a test fails?

==================

is code coverage better or worse?
 - no substantial difference; see 
     http://lyorn.idyll.org/~t/transfer/coverage/ for new
     http://lyorn.idyll.org/~t/transfer/coverage2/ for old

should the temp directory be axed each run??

===================

would be nice to have the test utilities separated from the test files.
maybe tests/testlib/, tests/something

===================

do the tests work with nose?
